## Description

This application was created as a way of automating the process of building a README.md file.  It is designed to prompt the user for information, translate the corresponding answers into a template, then write a new markdown file.

This project allowed me to again practice my Javascript skills, but also helped me work with node.js, and allowed me to experience building and running an app entirely within the command line interface.  I learned how to require the packages in the file, how to export modules from a different js file, and how to create a screencast.

## Installation

To install the application, make sure you are in the working directory for the app, and from the CLI, load the required packages by typing in "npm i". 

## Usage

Start the application from the CLI by typing "node index.js".  Then answer the questions in the prompts.  When all the questions are answered, the generated README.md file will be written to the "dist" folder in the directory.

## Credits

This code was written primarily with reference to classroom materials.  A tutor helped me with some specific questions and concepts that I had a hard time grasping.

I referenced a YouTube video series as well, for an idea of the thought process behind the code:
